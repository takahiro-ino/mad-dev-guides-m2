== Goals of this lab

The goal of this exercise is to build and deploy the modernized customer application to OpenShift using link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html-single/cicd/index#builds-binary-source_creating-build-inputs[OpenShift Binary Build and Deployment^].

You will:

* Use the OpenShift binary build strategy to build and deploy the new, modernized application using Red Hat JBoss Web Server instead of Apache Tomcat as the runtime.
* Test the new *customers* service

== 3.1. Create a new project

[IMPORTANT]
====
In case you haven't already logged in to the OpenShift cluster, run the following `oc` command in VS Code server terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc login -u %USERID% -p openshift https://openshift.default.svc:443
----
====

Create a new project in the OpenShift cluster to deploy our newly-modernized application, *customers*. Run the following command in the terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc new-project customers-qa-%USERID%
----

== 3.2. Prepare the directory structure

Create a directory for the binary build on your local file system and the `deployments/` subdirectory. Copy the WAR archive to `deployments/` directory by running the following commands in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cd $HOME/modern-app-dev/customers-tomcat-legacy

mkdir -p ocp/deployments

cp target/customers-tomcat-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war ocp/deployments/
----

== 3.3. Build the application container image

Create a new build configuration, specifying image stream and application name. Run the following command in the terminal to do this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc new-build --binary=true \
 --image-stream=jboss-webserver57-openjdk11-tomcat9-openshift-ubi8:latest \
 --name=customers
----

The output should look like this.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
--> Found image de5b7ae (5 weeks old) in image stream "openshift/jboss-webserver57-openjdk11-tomcat9-openshift-ubi8" under tag "latest" for "jboss-webserver57-openjdk11-tomcat9-openshift-ubi8:latest"

    JBoss Web Server 5.7 OpenJDK11 
    ------------------------------ 
    Platform for building and running web applications on JBoss Web Server 5.7 with OpenJDK11 - Tomcat v9

    Tags: builder, java, tomcat9

    * A source build using binary input will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "customers:latest"
      * A binary build was created, use 'oc start-build --from-dir' to trigger a new build

--> Creating resources with label build=customers ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "customers" created
    buildconfig.build.openshift.io "customers" created
--> Success
----

== 3.4. Start the binary build

Start the binary build based on that build configuration just created. Instruct OpenShift to use the `ocp` directory you created for the binary input for the image build.

Run the following command in the terminal to start the build:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc start-build customers --from-dir=./ocp --follow
----

The output should end up with this.

== 3.5. Create a new OpenShift application

Create a new OpenShift application based on the newly-built container image. Run the following command in the terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc new-app customers
----

The output should look like this.

[.console-output]

    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose service/customers' 
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

You can add the following label to show the application running on the JBoss Web Server. Run the following command in the terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc label deployment/customers app.openshift.io/runtime=rh-tomcat
----

== 3.6. Verify the new customers application

`Congratulations!` You just deployed a new *customers* application successfully to the OpenShift cluster. Access link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/customers-qa-%USERID%?view=graph[Topology view^] if the application is running in the customers-qa-%USERID% project.

image::customers-qa-topology.png[customers-qa-topology]

Access the following RESTful API of the customers application to retrieve the customer data in the new Oracle database on OpenShift virtualization.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl http://customers.customers-qa-%USERID%.svc.cluster.local:8080/customers-tomcat-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/customers/1 ; echo
----

The output should look like this.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
{"id":1,"username":"phlegm_master_19","name":"Guybrush","surname":"Threepwood","address":"1060 West Addison","zipCode":"ME-001","city":"Melee Town","country":"Melee Island"}
----

This shows that the newly-modernized application running on OpenShift can successfully retrieve customer data from the backend database.

== Summary

Congratulations! You have now successfully remediated all the migration issues you have found and refactored the legacy application. In the next module, you'll learn how to implement `CI/CD` and `GitOps` for advanced application management on your Red Hat OpenShift cluster.
